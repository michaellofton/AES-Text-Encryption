## Design Features
The majority of the functionality of the program was written in Java while parts of the graphical user interface and event handling were made using JavaFX. 

The program was created using the Model-view-controller design pattern, which creates a communication of data from the model (the part that performs encryption on text), the view (what the user sees) and the controller (the part that updates the view using information from the model).
